# `vvvvvv for vv for vvv`
Wrapper for [`vv`](http://github.com/bradp/vv), three times as long of a command, only works a third of the time.

# Usage

Add `vvvvvv` to somewhere in your $PATH, and use that instead of `vv`. You'll need `vv` installed in your path as well.

Forked from [`v`](https://github.com/bradp/v) by [Brad P](http://github.com/bradp/vv) author of [`vv`](http://github.com/bradp/vv) for [`VVV`](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV).
